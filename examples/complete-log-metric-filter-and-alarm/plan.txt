An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 6 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:

  + this_cloudwatch_metric_alarm_arn     = (known after apply)
  + this_cloudwatch_metric_alarm_id      = (known after apply)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
